  <p>Hi my name is Rodolfo</p>
      <img src="images/LittleMe.jpg" height="250">
  <p>With the money I had I decided to invest money in the MemeEconomy. This was the riskiest path I took in my life as the MemeEconomy was only
  one year old and no one knew if it would collapse or grow. I had to choose between many wonderful memes but I chose the Mocking Spongebob meme.
  I was laughed at by other MemeInvestors but at the end I got the last laugh.</p>

  <p>Then I got bored and paid my loan off, picked up my money gained from MemeInvestment, went home and apologized to parents and bought house to
  move to Patterson and I now attend to Patterson High School and we live a happy life.</p>
